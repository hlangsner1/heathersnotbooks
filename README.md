Welcome to Heather's Notebooks. Its just a tiny sampling of the kind of work I can do 
with data to do analysis about the impact that climate change 
can have on portfolio performance over the long term and some work I did recently 
on which industries are decarbonizing the fastest. I have also set up models to 
automate the incorporation of data into the EU PAI rules. As I go, I learn by doing. 

I am working on an integrated LCA/TEA model that I will provide here in the coming weeks.
